
WWW::Search::Backends distribution

This is a random collection of backends for WWW::Search.

For the most part, they are old / abandoned / not working, AFAICT.

Timezone and WatchNet are new and working as of 2006-07-31.

Contact the author / maintainer mentioned in each backend if you have any questions.
